TOLIMAN
=======
The goal of the TOLIMAN mission is to answer the question: is there a planet
around Alpha Centauri? The critical advance represented by the TOLIMAN 
telescope is its ability to assess a specific star. The TOLIMAN mission aims to detect the 
gravitational reflex motion of the host star induced by an Earth mass companion. For nearby stars 
the expected signal strength is expected to
be sub-Âµas - well below the diffraction limit of most telescopes. To achieve this TOLIMAN
will be launched into space with new technologies that will attempt to beat this limit.
This page contains the forwards model that will be used to extract any signals.
